# CS-250-Final-Project-Sprint-Review-Agile-Presentation

## Project Overview

This repository contains my final deliverables for **CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle** at **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**.
The project demonstrates my understanding of the Scrum-Agile methodology, its comparison to the traditional Waterfall model, and my reflections on its application in the SNHU Travel case study.

The deliverables include both a written **Sprint Review & Retrospective report** and a **PowerPoint presentation** designed to communicate Agile principles, roles, and methodologies to a broader audience.

## Reflection Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by actively listening to stakeholders, analyzing their goals, and translating those goals into functional requirements. In Agile, this process is streamlined by creating **user stories**, which describe what the user wants and why in clear, simple terms. User stories help break down complex needs into manageable pieces of work that can be prioritized and implemented iteratively. This ensures that the program evolves directly in response to user feedback and delivers features that provide real value.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative and collaborative. I start by defining clear goals, breaking them down into smaller tasks, and then working through them in cycles that allow for continuous improvement. Agile processes like **sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives** keep development focused and adaptable. In my future work, I hope to continue using these practices because they not only improve efficiency but also create a strong feedback loop between developers and stakeholders.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing code—it means communicating, supporting teammates, and contributing to a culture of trust and respect. A good team member values collaboration, takes ownership of their work, and stays adaptable when project needs change. Most importantly, they focus on the shared goal of delivering value to the customer rather than individual achievement.
