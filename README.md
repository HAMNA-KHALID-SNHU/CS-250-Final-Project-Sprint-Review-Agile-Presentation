# CS-250-Final-Project-Sprint-Review-Agile-Presentation

# Project Overview

This repository contains my final deliverables for CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).
The project demonstrates my understanding of the Scrum-Agile methodology, its comparison to the traditional Waterfall model, and my reflections on its application in the SNHU Travel case study.

The deliverables include both a written Sprint Review & Retrospective report and a PowerPoint presentation designed to communicate Agile principles, roles, and methodologies to a broader audience.
